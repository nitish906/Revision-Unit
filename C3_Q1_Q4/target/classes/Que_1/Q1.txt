
Q1/-  What do you mean by the IOC, explain the life cycle of the SpringBean.


      When we want to create dependencies and we take the help of external entity to maintain the 
      dependencies with simplified manner which is maintain by the IOC container..
	  Basically Spring IOC is the Spring configuration which takes care about the dependencies injections, 
	  Object creation and the manages the component of the objects in the "Spring configuration file" which 
	  known as the Spring IOC.
	
     Spring Bean means the class who assosiate with spring container is known as spring bean.

     in simple java classes constructor and finalize() methods are the  life cycle methods 
     In spring spring container controls the spring bean life-cycle.
     there is initalization and destroy methods.
     There are 5 stages of spring bean class in life cycle

     1)not exist
     2)Instansiate
     3)intialized
     4)service
     5)Destroy


    1)At first there s no spring bean object exist.if bean object is singleton scope bean will load by container
    at a time of loading xml file.


   2)After this Container load the bean class into the memory and creates the bean class object 
   also uses some property and value tags to insert data in bean fields.Also all the dependencies
   is also resolved at a time of loading.

  3) In any bean class if there is init method is configured container will call that method automatically.

  4)In Service phase Container provides bean object ref to client,and client and call the service mthod on that 
  bean object.

  5)Same as init method we have to configure destroy method and call that method by bean object 
  to destroy bean object.
